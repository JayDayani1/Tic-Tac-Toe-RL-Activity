# Tic-Tac-Toe-RL-Activity
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game using reinforcement learning. The project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Project Description

### Objective

The objective of this project is to use reinforcement learning to train an agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. The key tasks include:

1. **Game Implementation**: Implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe game environment.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Setup**: Setting up the reinforcement learning framework.
3. **Training the Agent**: Training the agent using reinforcement learning algorithms.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained agent.

## File Description

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyter`

The project involved implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game and training an agent using reinforcement learning techniques. The steps were as follows:

**Game Implementation**: The Tic-Tac-Toe game was implemented, providing an environment for the agent to interact with.

**Reinforcement Learning Setup:** The reinforcement learning framework was set up, including defining states, actions, rewards, and the policy.

**Training the Agent:** The agent was trained using reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal strategies for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Evaluation:** The performance of the trained agent was evaluated, demonstrating its ability to play the game effectively and make optimal moves.

The reinforcement learning agent successfully learned to play Tic-Tac-Toe, showcasing the potential of reinforcement learning techniques for game-playing and decision-making tasks.
